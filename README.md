### What is Data Science?
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many data types. Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, and their related methods" to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It involves techniques and theories from many fields within mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge, and information science. Data science combines data inference, algorithm development, and technology to solve analytically complex problems. It gauges metrics and monitors business activities, equipping organizations with the ability to make informed decisions. Across industries, data science is used to make strategic choices, improve business operations, and predict consumer behavior. Machine learning, a key concept in data science, uses algorithms to draw patterns from data, learn from it, and make data-driven decisions. Data scientists handle big data in its raw form, extract statistical features, build models, and visualize data for easy understanding. Data science is all about using data to create as much impact as possible for businesses and organizations. In today's fast-paced world, where data generation is perpetually increasing, data science is a highly sought-after field.
